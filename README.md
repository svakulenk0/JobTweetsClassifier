# Feel the Buzz - a JobTweetsClassifier

Goal: text classifier for tweets containing job offers

Requirements: minimum supervision in terms of prior linguistic knowledge, e.g. a character-based classifier (characters as input to the classifier)

## Roadmap

1. Load dump of tweets (Settings -> Content -> Your Twitter archive -> Request your archive)
2. Manually mark tweets with a job posting as positive samples (True)
3. Train a classifier to detect job tweets, e.g. fastText
